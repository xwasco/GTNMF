  "body": "### What is ?\r\nGTNMF is a game-theoretic method to refine the clustering obtained via NMF. The refinement of the assignment is obtained throuh this setting:\r\n* The elements to be clustered are the players\r\n* The similarities between the players defines who is playing with. The rationale is that players want to play with similar level players.\r\n* The assignment elements-clusters takes into account the similarity between objects and their membership choices rearraging the un-coherent ones.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
