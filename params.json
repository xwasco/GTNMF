The refinement of the assignment is obtained throuh this game-theoretic setting:\r\n* The elements to be clustered are the players\r\n* The similarities between the players defines who is playing with. The rationale is that players want to play with similar level players.\r\n* The assignment elements-clusters takes into account the similarity between objects and their membership choices rearraging the un-coherent ones.\r\n\r\nThe initialization of the game is provided by the soft-clustering obtained by an NMF clustering method.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis work has been developed by Rocco Tripodi @roccotrip , Sebastiano Vascon @xwasco and Marcello Pelillo.
